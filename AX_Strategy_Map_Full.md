# Agent Experience (AX) Strategy Map

### *By Katja Forbes*

## Signal Clarity

*Make your business legible to machines.*

| Area | Diagnostic Question | Actions to Take |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structured Data** | Are your products, services, and offers described using machine-readable formats (e.g., JSON, schema.org)? | Implement structured metadata across all digital assets. Use schema.org, OpenAPI specs, and rich snippets. |
| **API Availability** | Can agents access real-time product, pricing, or availability data via API? | Develop and expose secure, well-documented APIs for key services. |
| **Data Freshness** | Is your information current and automatically refreshed? | Automate updates via backend integrations; expose cache-busting timestamps. |
| **Interoperability** | Can machine agents easily integrate your services with others in their ecosystem? | Use industry standards for data formatting and service delivery. Avoid proprietary-only formats. |

## Reputation via Reliability

*Establish machine-readable trust.*

| Area | Diagnostic Question | Actions to Take |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance Transparency** | Do you provide measurable service-level metrics (uptime, latency, error rates)? | Publish and monitor a public status page. Include machine-readable SLAs and KPIs. |
| **Compliance Signals** | Are you broadcasting your regulatory compliance or certifications in a verifiable format? | Digitally certify ISO, ESG, GDPR, etc. via blockchain or verifiable credentials. |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Can your systems identify unusual or potentially fraudulent agent behaviours? | Implement behavioral baselines and pattern monitoring for agent interactions. |
| **Feedback Loops** | Are your reviews and ratings agent-digestible (e.g., from verified sources, structured data)? | Integrate third-party review signals via APIs (e.g., Trustpilot, Glassdoor, G2). Ensure they’re machine-readable. |

## Intent Translation

*Align your offering with machine priorities.*

| Area | Diagnostic Question | Actions to Take |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Semantic Clarity** | Can agents understand your value prop without human interpretation? | Use NLP-optimized descriptions, semantic tagging, and explicit benefit statements. |
| **Matchmaking Compatibility** | Can your services be matched against agent queries and preferences? | Adopt common taxonomies, intent mapping, and digital twin technology. |
| **Dynamic Customization** | Can you adapt offers based on agent-level data inputs? | Use adaptive pricing models, rule-based personalization, and conditional offers. |
| **Trust Signals** | Are your values and differentiators quantifiable and comparable? | Express differentiators in metrics, not adjectives—e.g., “12% faster delivery” not “world-class service.” |

## Agent Engagement Architecture

*Design your systems for machine interaction patterns.*

| Area | Diagnostic Question | Actions to Take |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Authentication & Security** | Can agents securely authenticate and maintain session state? | Implement OAuth 2.0, API keys, and agent identity verification. Consider zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive operations. |
| **Rate Limiting & Resource Allocation** | Are you prepared for variable machine traffic patterns and resource demands? | Design tiered access models with adaptive rate limits. Implement graceful degradation protocols. |
| **Learning Integration** | Can your systems learn from agent interactions to improve offerings? | Deploy interaction analytics, implement A/B testing for agent preferences, and build feedback mechanisms specific to agent behavior patterns. |
| **Decision Transparency** | Can agents understand why specific recommendations or decisions were made? | Provide decision trees or confidence scores alongside recommendations. Implement explainable AI principles. |
