## Prompt: Exploring Emerging Machine Customers in Your Industry

**Task:**  
Using the Machine Customer Persona Template (with sliders and structured fields), help me explore and define a potential or emerging machine customer in the context of my industry.

---

## Instructions:

1. Assume this machine customer is either currently forming or will be relevant within the next 1–3 years.
2. Populate each of the 10 sections of the persona template thoughtfully:
   - Ground your responses in current trends, systems, or likely future behavior.
   - Where knowledge is limited, make plausible inferences based on similar customer patterns.
3. Rate the following sliders from 1–5 and justify each:
   - **Autonomy** (1 = human-directed, 5 = fully autonomous)
   - **Decision Transparency** (1 = opaque, 5 = fully explainable)
   - **Loyalty Volatility** (1 = highly sticky, 5 = easily switchable)
